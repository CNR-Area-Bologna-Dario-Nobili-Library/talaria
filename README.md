# Requirements
To run the software you need docker is installed in your environment

# Install
1. Change settings in `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`
2. Check that your hostname matches `API_DOMAIN` and `FRONTEND_DOMAIN` as it was used for `traefik` load balancer; check also that the `UID` matches the user's ID running docker
3. Upload your server (and api-server) SSL certificates into `docker/certs` folder and update `SSL_CERT_PATH,SSL_KEY_PATH,SSL_API_CERT_PATH,SSL_API_KEY_PATH` variables in `.env` file accordingly
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all needed containers

# Configuration
## Frontend/ReactJS
The frontend don't need any configuration; it's based on a nodejs container
and it automatically downloads and installs every needed component using `npm`.

## Backend/Laravel 
Run these commands from `talaria-laravel` container ONLY THE FIRST TIME you run the application
```bash
composer install    #download vendor folder
php artisan migrate # create DB
php artisan passport:install # create oAuth2 auth keys used by API (you've to keep credentials provided and put in in your `.env` as described below)
composer dump-autoload
php artisan optimize
```
Then change `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` accordingly to ones generated by `php artisan passport:install` command used before.

All scheduled/queued jobs are managed by `laravelqueue` and `laravelscheduler` containers

## Configuration updates
If you change something in the Laravel configuration or in `.env` you've to rebuild Laravel cache runing these commands from `talaria-laravel` container:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan optimize
```


## Initial setup

```bash
php artisan db:seed # DB init

username: manager@talaria.local    password: password
```

## Database

### Database backup
`dbbackup` container (see configuration parameters in `docker-compose.yml` ) automatically saved a local DB dump in the folder specified by `DB_BACKUP_FOLDER` variable defined in `.env` file
