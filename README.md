The software requires docker installed in your environment.

# Install
1. change settings in `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`
2. check that your hostname matches `API_DOMAIN` and `FRONTEND_DOMAIN` as it was used for `traefik` load balancer 
3. upload your server SSL certificates into `docker/certs` folder and update `SSL_CERT_PATH,SSL_KEY_PATH` variables in `.env` file accordingly
4. run `docker-compose up -d` to start all needed containers

# Configuration
## Frontend/ReactJS
The frontend don't need any configuration; it's based on a nodejs container
and it automatically downloads and installs every needed component using `npm`.

## Backend/Laravel 
Run these commands from `talaria-laravel` container ONLY THE FIRST TIME you run the application
```bash
composer install    #download vendor folder
php artisan migrate # create DB
php artisan passport:install # create oAuth2 auth keys used by API (you've to keep credentials provided and put in in your `.env` as described below)
composer dump-autoload
php artisan optimize
```
Then change `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` accordingly to ones generated by `php artisan passport:install` command used before.

Add then these lines to your `crontab` to run Laravel scheduler:
```
* * * * * cd <path-to-your-project> && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Initial setup
Run these commands from `talaria-laravel` container ONLY THE FIRST TIME you run the application
```bash
php artisan db:seed # DB init
```
This command will initialize DB with some usefull data likes countries, identifiers, institution-types, titles, roles ... and two user account to manage the system directly from web UI:
```
username: admin@talaria.eu      password: password

username: manager@talaria.eu    password: password
```

## DB access
You can access DB data using PHPMyAdmin at `http://${API_DOMAIN}/phpmyadmin/`  (see `phpmyadmin` container for configuration)
