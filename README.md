The software requires docker installed in your environment.

# Install
1. change settings in `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`
2. check that your hostname matches `API_DOMAIN` and `FRONTEND_DOMAIN` as it was used for `traefik` load balancer 
3. `docker network create proxy`
4. run `docker-compose up -d` to start all needed containers

# Configuration
## Frontend/ReactJS 1st setup 
The frontend don't need any configuration; it's based on a nodejs container
running the application by command `npm start` as the container starts

To download all packages the 1st time, run these from `frontend` container:
```bash
npm install 
```

## Backend/Laravel 1st setup 
(run these from `laravel` container)
```bash
composer install    #download vendor folder
php artisan key:generate  # creates a new APP_KEY and saved in .env
php artisan migrate # create DB
php artisan passport:install # create oAuth2 auth keys
php artisan db:seed # DB init


```
Then change `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` accordingly to ones generated by `php artisan passport:install` command used before.

Add then these lines to your `crontab` to run Laravel scheduler:
```
* * * * * cd <path-to-your-project> && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
